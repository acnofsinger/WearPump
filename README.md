Integration of Dexcom and TSlim Insulin Pump Data with WearOS devices
My goal in creating WearPump was to make interacting with my TSlim insulin pump easier.  I kept finding myself in situations that where it wasn't ideal to pull out my pump or my mobile phone in order to check my CGM and/or initiate a bolus.  Whether I was in a meeting at work, putting my baby to sleep at night, or waking up in the middle of the night, I wanted a quicker, easier way to manage my pump.  With WearPump you can check all of your pump data, (Battery Level, Cartridge Level, Insulin On Board, Percent in Range, and Basal Rate).  If you want to initiate a bolus you can click on the Tandem Icon on the watchface and it shows a Bolus screen with pre-programmed bolus amounts.  These can be edited easily in the Tasker App.  If you're interested in giving this a try please go to the Instructions page and give it a go.

Many thanks!!  Adam
